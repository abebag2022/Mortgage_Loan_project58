# Mortgage_Loan_Application_project
This Repository contains SQL queries and power BI report for analyzing Mortgage loan application of  1003 customers across the state. 
## Project Overview
This SQL project aims to develop a robust and efficient database system to manage mortgage loan applications. The system will track various aspects of the loan application process, including borrower information, property details, loan terms, and financial history. By leveraging SQL's powerful query capabilities, I effectively analyzed and make a report using power bi on key metrics to support informed decision-making.
## Database Design:
The database schema is designed to accommodate the diverse needs of a mortgage lending institution. Key tables and their relationships are outlined below:
- Borrower_detail
- property_details
- loan_details
- Financial_details
## Key KPIs:
- Loan origination volume
- Average loan amount
- Default rate
- Customer acquisition cost
- Loan approval rate-
- Portfolio turnover rate
## Visualizations using power BI:
- Line charts to track trends over time (e.g., loan amount, purpose of loan)
- Bar charts to compare performance across different segments (e.g., loan to date, property types)
- Pie charts to visualize the distribution of loan amount over the year
- Area chart to visualize geographic distribution of loans and properties
